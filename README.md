Hi, Iâ€™m Tomas Van Den Noortgate, also known as Rpone. I'm a bit of a tech hobbyist, and a computer science student at the KULeuven university, Belgium. 
Therefore, on this github page you will mostly find study related projects, with some free-time projects mixed in. 
If you want to, feel free to reach me via e-mail at tomas.vdn@hotmail.com or via discord (Rpone#7155).
